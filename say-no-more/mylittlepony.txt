When I took the job, I braced myself for criticism, expecting many people — without even watching the show — to instantly label it girly, stupid, cheap, for babies or an evil corporate commercial. I encourage skeptics like this to watch My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic with an open mind. If I'm doing my job right, I think you’ll be surprised.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- Lauren Faust
Roddenberry warned me that I had no idea what I was getting into with Star Trek. Someone should have warned me about My Little Pony! Egads!<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- John de Lancie
I love bronies, and you guys are changing the way I look at adult males who view cartoons... Maybe, like, feminine-ish cartoons.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- Ashleigh Ball
Lyra, Heartstrings, or Incidental Unicorn #2.... When I first started working on the show, I never expected people to latch on to the background ponies like they have. It's nice to see.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- Nayuki
I'm constantly surprised by how many men love MLP, (even marines!) and it proves something I've always believed: that innocence is [in]finite. It's not something that can ever go away despite what a person does or has done.<br>P.S. Derpy is the pinnacle of the top of the peak for me!<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- Tabitha St. Germain
When I came into Star Trek with Patrick, the Star Trek fan base had already been established. I feel like I’m at the beginning and watching of a new fan base and I want to invite you who are Trek fans to embrace Friendship Is Magic fans because I discovered that we all have a lot in common.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- John de Lancie
There's more than one way to be a girl.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- Lauren Faust
Aren't you gonna stay for brunch?
Ten. Seconds. Flat.
All the ponies in this town are CRAZY!
One pony plus hundreds of apple trees just doesn't add up.
Pinkie Pie, you are so random!
Well, well, well. It seems we have some neigh-sayers in the audience.
How dare you? HOW DARE YOU?!
The Everfree Forest just ain't natural! The plants grow... Animals care for themselves... And the clouds move... All on their own!
Beware! Beware, you pony folk!<br>Those leaves of blue are not a joke!
Tales of crops and harvests consumed.<br>If these creatures are in Ponyville...you’re doomed.
It needs to be about 20% cooler.
Louder!
Yay.
Come on, guys. We're not gonna find the chicken or our cutie marks by arguing.
I am not whining, I am complaining! Do you want to hear whining? <i>(in higher-pitched voice) This</i> is whining! Ooh, this harness is too tight! It's going to chafe! Can't you loosen it? Ooh, it hurts and it's so rusty! Why didn't you clean it first? It's going to leave a stain. The wagon's getting heavy! Why do I have to pull it?!?
Cross my heart and hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my eye!
Forrrreeeeverrrr!
I'd like to be a tree.
Nobody move, and my dress won't get hurt! Stay back! Back, I say!
You'd never guess, but when I was little I was very shy.
Okey...dokey...lokey.
You're...going to LOVE ME!
What are you, a dictionary?
Hold on a second! Eternal chaos comes with chocolate rain, you guys! CHOCOLATE RAIN!
Make sense? Oh, what fun is there in making sense?
This is my book, and I'm going to READ IT!
HI GIRRLLS!
If I can't find a friendship problem...I'll make a friendship problem!
Of all the worst things that could happen, this is THE. WORST. POSSIBLE. THING!
It is tradition to speak using the Royal "We", AND TO USE THIS MUCH VOLUME WHEN ADDRESSING OUR SUBJECTS!
Is this thing on? I don't think this thing is on. Hello! What is the...eh...oh... you have to say so. Confangled modern doohickey! Now the event y'all been waiting for! The Sistersoci...The Socialhoof...Oh! Dabnabbit...you know, the big race! We have five teams this year for the event! So all y'all head on up to the finish line, hear? Eh? The start line! That's what I said!
Applejack, why do you have to be so good and make me look so bad?
Sacrebleu! Plus de marques de cutie! [gasps] Qu'est-ce que c'est? Je parle français?
Dun-dun-dunnnn!!
C'mon, you guys! Let's show them how to party, Ponyville-style!
SPIKE WANT!
Twilight, get my rope.
This is a crime against fashion!
Actually, I don't really hate her. I just really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really dislike her.
I just don't know what went wrong.
NOPONY breaks a Pinkie promise!
Dear Princess Celestia, I wanted to share my thoughts with you. *a-HEM* I didn't learn anythin'! Ha, I was right all along!
I'm an egghead.
OH, COME ON!
Ee-yup.
That's Future Spike's problem.
Fighting's not really my thing, I'm more into fashion... but I'll rip you to pieces if you touch one scale on his cute little head!
I want a flugelhorn!
Friendship Is Magic.
A little while ago, my teacher and mentor Princess Celestia sent me to live in Ponyville. She sent me to study friendship, which is something I didn't really care much about. But now, on a day like today, I can honestly say I wouldn't be standing here if it weren't for the friendships I've made with all of you. Each one of you taught me something about friendship, and for that, I will always be grateful. Today, I consider myself the luckiest pony in Equestria. Thank you, friends, thank you, everypony.
"Is he friend, or is he foe?" The pony wonders. I can assure you I am no friend. I am Lord Tirek. And I will take what should have been mine long ago!
